# Personal Journaling Application
#### Description:
**what is it?**
It's and very simple diary app with Python that works in your terminal.

**Requirements:**
You need Python on your machine to work with this diary.
You can download Python from [Python Website.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**How to run it?**
After downloading the app in your terminal move to the app directory and type `python diary.py` and press `Enter`.

**why I wrote this**
Actually it was a project for my CS50x course. Of course, it could be more user-friendly and easy to run(e.g. Notepad is a more straightforward app) but as a person who recently started to learn Python and programming it was a coll app for me and I lik it.

**Feel free to add any feature and send your request, I appreciate it.**
